## Admin Login Information
* Admin ID: Tania
* Admin Password: 1234

* I completed all the requirements without view user page done and delete button because I faced a problem

## Issus that are not solved
* For viewing all users information in a table and display dynamically I used template string. When I tried a onclick and a function within it it worked perfectly but for I needed single id for delete or done button functional. For that I used arrow function but this time I din't get axpected result. I've tried many ways but at last I can not solve it. In future I'll defenetly solve this

## Issus that I solved
* In user information page where is user's name and image filed. There is also a view button in the top and right that page. When I click on it a popup or modal show but I could not display the same name and image. I solved that issue
* In user's view page when I face data, there was displayed all data user and admin. But I needed only user data. Then I filter without admin role and then displayed them perfectly. I faced also some more issues that I already solved.
